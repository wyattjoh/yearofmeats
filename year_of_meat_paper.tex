% 3. An initial thesis for your paper (this, too, may evolve as you write—which
% is good!)
% \textbf{Thesis:} The practices and goals of the Beef Export and Trade
% Syndicate and beef industry as described in Ruth Ozeki's book
% \citetitle{ozeki1998my} and their use of antibiotics and hormones directly
% influences the drastic changes to the characters physically, which is
% illustrated by the tone, and the relationships.

One of the most influential entities in Ruth Ozeki's book
\citetitle{ozeki1998my} is the Beef Export and Trade Syndicate (or BEEF-EX),
a large lobby group representing the interests of ``beef, pork, lamb, goat,
horse—as well as livestock producers, packers, purveyors, exporters, grain
promoters, pharmaceutical companies, and agribusiness groups''
\cite{ozeki1998my}. As we are given insight into the operations of these
industries through characters at different levels of involvement with the
industry, there are instances of corporate greed that can be identified. It
can be seen that the industry is willing to sacrifice the well being of
their customers during the production of the BEEF-EX sponsored show, ``My
American Wife''. We also learn about the major role that pharmaceutical
companies play in the production of meat, primarily in the use of
Diethylstilbestrol (or DES). We learn that these drastic drugs were used to
simply fatten up the cattle faster. This unfortunately had the side effect
of causing massive damage to a females reproductive system. Ultimately, what
is at stake here is the morals of corporations and the health effects that
are resultant from those profit maximizing behaviours, which everyone can
agree is something to be concerned about.

% Topics:
%   1. DES, and it's affects

When it comes to the health of the masses, it can be clear that a good
quarterly statement reflects worse than health concerns. Until 1959, the use
of DES was quite rampant in the poultry industry, as it enhanced many traits
that made the meat more desirable. At that point however, the issues with
DES became clear with ``dogs and males from low-income families in the South
were developing signs of feminization after eating cheap chicken parts and
wastes from processing plants'' \cite{ozeki1998my}, and the Federal Drug
Administration (or FDA) banned it for use with poultry. This didn't seem to
affect however when in 1954, the FDA approved the use of DES for cattle,
heralding it as ````miracle'' and ``a revolution in the cattle industry,''''
\cite{ozeki1998my}. This then leading to DES becoming ``used by more than 95
percent of U.S. cattle feeders to speed up production'' \cite{ozeki1998my}.
When the evidence became clear that there was so many medical reasons to
stop using DES, it still took the FDA until 1979 to actually ban it's use in
livestock production. As a reader, I felt very moved by these issues raised
and faced by Jane. The issues that she encountered were the resultant of the
choices her mother made, the food she ate, and the environments that she was
exposed to. The importance of the changes highlight the struggle that takes
place in-between what we think is safe or not safe to eat. From the
beginning of the book, Jane developed and learned so much about the beef
industry, specifically relating to her own personal health. Her discovery of
DES ``ultimately changed my relationship with meats and television. It also
changed the course of my life'' \cite{ozeki1998my}. When describing the
resulting damage of Jane's uterus from the DES that her mother took during
her pregnancy, she referred to the ideal one looking like ``head of a bull,
with the fallopian tubes spreading and curling like noble horns'', while as
a result of the hormones before birth ``[t]he left side of the bull’s broad
forehead was caved in, less triangular, as though my uterus had been
coldcocked'' \cite{ozeki1998my}. These changes then described to her mother
will highlight the difference over generations, that her mother was not even
aware of these issues back then. In fact, her mother didn't even know the
drugs that she was given, she ``try everything. Some vitamin, some Doctor
Ing-san medicine'' \cite{ozeki1998my}. This shows the blind faith in the
doctor that she had, eventually resulting in being given DES. The doctors
prescribed this even when studies that were released at the same time when
it was approved for cattle, DES ``showed a significant increase not only in
miscarriages but also in premature births and infant deaths''
\cite{ozeki1998my}. It's not like this wasn't common knowledge anyways, as
the very same drug that was used by pregnant women to strengthen their
children was ``even used as a morning-after pill to terminate pregnancy''
\cite{ozeki1998my}. This contrasts the attitude that Jane had when she was
prescribed Tace for her pains after the miscarriage. Armed with the
knowledge of the drug industry, Jane looked it up, just to find that it
could actually be quite harmful to someone with her condition! This will
relate quite nicely to the idea of the trust that the meat industry has, or
rather had relating to the safety of their products. It was the simple fact
that the corporations ignored the evidence, as they were making profit.

Jane's development of the relationships with the people that she filmed
provided another insight to the industries goals. Lara and Dyann in the
novel are used as a pipeline to describe factual and historical evidence of
the food and drug industry and the lengths that some people go to avoid the
issues that are caused by them. Dyann went so far as to state that they
could ``never eat it[meat] the way it’s produced here in America. It’s
unhealthy. Not to mention corrupt, inhumane, and out of control''
\cite{ozeki1998my}. They also play an important role in describing some of
the facts to Jane when she is preparing her documentary. Another character
that provided a lot of information on the industry was Bunny and Rosie.
Their role was more of a direct effect of the results of the industry as they
lived on a cattle ranch. As a result of the exposure to DES, Bunny's
daughter, Rosie, suffered greatly. Rosie underwent puberty at age 5,
developing traits that would have taken many more years to develop. These as
a direct result of the extremely high amounts of DES in the environment. Jane
later used footage of Rosie to spark a controversy relating to the illegal
use of DES in 1991, which was 12 years after is was supposedly banned in
livestock production.

% I found it quite entertaining the attitude that Jane took starting near the
% middle of the book of essentially ignoring the requests of John and BEEF-EX
% regarding the ``Pork is Possible, but Beef is Best!'' \cite{ozeki1998my}
% motto. While this doesn't specifically highlight the hormones and
% antibiotics used, these actions are almost taken in direct response to her
% finding out more about the industry and wanting to reveal more of the
% ``real'' world of beef. This will then be supported by the descriptions of
% her actions taken in the feed lots and the killing/packing plant.

The mood of the novel also changes from the start of the book. In the
beginning, Jane seems to be looking forward to the employment, which would
keep her fed and employed for over a year, this can be seen as the optimism
or the innocence of the American public with relation to the industry. When
we learn more about the use of hormones and drugs used in the book, the tone
becomes much darker. First with Jane's miscarriage, and then Akiko's husband
beating her, resulting in her fleeing to America to have her child. This
flow can be contrasted with the same attitude that Jane takes with regards
to the requests of the Tokyo office to use the ``Ideal American Family'' as
described by being free of ```1. Physical imperfections 2. Obesity 3. Squalor
4. Second class peoples'' \cite{ozeki1998my}. At the beginning, she follows
the requests pretty well, selecting families falling within these boundaries.
Later, she begins to choose families that are not fitting to the
description, an American-Mexican family, a vegetarian lesbian family, and
the Bukowsky family were some of the personal rebellions that she took.

Essentially, I am arguing that the corporate entities within Ruth Ozeki's
book \citetitle{ozeki1998my} act with a profit first approach which results
in physical and psychological damage to the consumers of its products and
content. Everything from the drugs that they marketed, to the food they
produced, all tainted by corporate greed.
