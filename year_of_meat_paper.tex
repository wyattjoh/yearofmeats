\title{Cooperate Greed in Ruth Ozeki's \citetitle{ozeki1998my}}

One of the most influential entities in Ruth Ozeki's book
\citetitle{ozeki1998my} is the Beef Export and Trade Syndicate (or BEEF-EX),
a large lobby group representing the interests of ``beef, pork, lamb, goat,
horse—as well as livestock producers, packers, purveyors, exporters, grain
promoters, pharmaceutical companies, and agribusiness groups'' \cite[Ch.
1]{ozeki1998my}. As we learn about the operations of these industries
through characters at different levels of involvement with the meat
industry, we find many instances of corporate greed. The industry is willing
to sacrifice the well being of their customers during the production of the
BEEF-EX sponsored show, ``My American Wife!'' We also learn about the major
role that pharmaceutical companies play in the production of meat, primarily
in the use of Diethylstilbestrol (or DES). We learn that these drastic drugs
were used to simply improve efficiency, but unfortunately had the side
effect of causing massive damage to a female consumer's reproductive system.
A company such as BEEF-EX cannot both maximize profit and remain morally
conscious.

% DES became clear when ``dogs and males from low-income families in the South
% were developing signs of feminization after eating cheap chicken parts and
% wastes from processing plants'' \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}, and the Federal Drug
% Administration (FDA) banned it for use with poultry. In 1954, the FDA approved the use of DES for cattle,
% heralding it as ````miracle'' and ``a revolution in the cattle industry,''''
% \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}. As a result, DES was then ``used by more than 95
% percent of U.S. cattle feeders to speed up production'' \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}.
% When the evidence became clear that there were many medical reasons to

%   Storytelling
%
% - characters viewpoint on BEEF-EX
% - Are the characters described such that the reader identifies with them?
% - Jane and her mother's relationship

Storytelling is used in \citetitle{ozeki1998my} to provide personal insight
into the workings of BEEF-EX as well as providing a character that the
reader can identify with. The main character in the story, Jane, is a
producer for the new Japanese television show ``My American Wife'' where she
must travel around the United States to find housewives that can be featured
on the show as to encourage the sale of American beef as per the sponsors
intentions. Initially, Jane is innocent to the idea that the beef that she
is marketing is hiding a dark secret. When it is later revealed to her, she
only eats organic red meats if she does at all \cite[Ch. 9]{ozeki1998my}. The
believable nature of Jane makes it really easy for a reader to personally
identify with the issues that she encounters. Through the story, we are exposed
to a variety of situations that are simply used by the author to provide
factual evidence to support the corruption both in the meat and in the
processes of BEEF-EX. One of the most powerful and longest periods that we
learn about information through story was that of Jane's own attempts at
having children, and her discovery of DES which
% The issues that she encountered were the result of the choices her mother
% made, the food she ate, and the environments that she was exposed to. The
% importance of the changes highlight the struggle that takes place in-between
% what we think is safe or not safe to eat. From the beginning of the book,
% Jane developed and learned so much about the beef industry, specifically
% relating to her own personal health. Her discovery of DES
``ultimately changed my relationship with meats and television. It also
changed the course of my life'' \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}. When describing
the resulting damage of Jane's uterus from the DES that her mother took
during her pregnancy, she referred to the ideal one looking like ``head of a
bull, with the fallopian tubes spreading and curling like noble horns'',
while as a result of the hormones before birth ``[t]he left side of the
bull’s broad forehead was caved in, less triangular, as though my uterus had
been coldcocked'' \cite[Ch. 7]{ozeki1998my}. These changes then described to
her mother will highlight the difference over generations, that her mother
was not even aware of these issues back then. In fact, her mother didn't
even know the drugs that she was given, she ``try everything. Some vitamin,
some Doctor Ing-san medicine'' \cite[Ch. 11]{ozeki1998my}. This shows the
blind faith in the doctor that she had, eventually resulting in being given
DES. The doctors prescribed this even when studies that were released at the
same time when it was approved for cattle, DES ``showed a significant
increase not only in miscarriages but also in premature births and infant
deaths'' \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}. It's not like this wasn't common
knowledge anyways, as the very same drug that was used by pregnant women to
strengthen their children was ``even used as a morning-after pill to
terminate pregnancy'' \cite[Ch. 6]{ozeki1998my}. This contrasts the attitude
that Jane had when she was prescribed Tace for her pains after the
miscarriage. Armed with the knowledge of the drug industry, Jane looked it
up, just to find that it could actually be quite harmful to someone with her
condition! This will relate quite nicely to the idea of the trust that the
meat industry has, or rather had relating to the safety of their products.
It was the simple fact that the corporations ignored the evidence, as they
were making profit.

Jane's development of the relationships with the people that she filmed
provided another insight to the industries goals. Lara and Dyann in the
novel are used as a pipeline to describe factual and historical evidence of
the food and drug industry and the lengths that some people go to avoid the
issues that are caused by them. Dyann went so far as to state that they
could ``never eat it[meat] the way it’s produced here in America. It’s
unhealthy. Not to mention corrupt, inhumane, and out of control''
\cite[Ch. 8]{ozeki1998my}. Another character that provided a lot of
information on the industry was Bunny and Rosie. Their role was more of a
direct effect of the results of the industry as they lived on a cattle
ranch. As a result of the exposure to DES, Bunny's daughter, Rosie, suffered
greatly. Rosie underwent puberty at age 5, developing traits that would have
taken many more years to develop; a direct result of the extremely high
amounts of DES in the environment. Jane later used footage of Rosie to spark
a controversy relating to the illegal use of DES in 1991, which was 12 years
after is was supposedly banned in livestock production. This of course as
motivated by the profits, as without the use of these artificial growth
accelerants, they could have gone out of business like Jane's grandparents.

% MOOD
%
% - Changes from looking foward to the futre, optimism, innocence to a feeling
%   of lack of control and dispair

The mood of the novel changes from the start of the book, and reflects the
opinion that Jane has on the industry. In the beginning, Jane seems to be
looking forward to ``My American Wife!'' which would ``land [her] a job and
keep [her] both meat-fed and employed for over a year''
\cite[Ch. 1]{ozeki1998my}. Her naive outlook on the meat industry can be
seen as a symbol for the innocence of the American public with relation to
the industry. When we learn more about the use of hormones and drugs used in
the book, the mood becomes much darker. First with Jane's miscarriage, and
then Akiko's husband beating her, resulting in her fleeing to America to
have her child. This flow can be contrasted with the same attitude that Jane
takes with regards to the requests of the Tokyo office to use the ``Ideal
American Family'' as described by being free of ```1. Physical imperfections
2. Obesity 3. Squalor 4. Second class peoples'' \cite[Ch. 1]{ozeki1998my}.
Jane began by selecting families within these boundaries at the beginning.
Later, she begins to choose families that are not fitting to the
description, an American-Mexican family, a vegetarian lesbian family, and
the Bukowsky family were some of the personal rebellions that she took.

%% SETTING

Essentially, I am arguing that the corporate entities as described within
Ruth Ozeki's book \citetitle{ozeki1998my} act with a profit first approach
which results in physical and psychological damage to the consumers of its
products and content. The drugs were used, even though clear evidence that
they were unfit for human consumption. These drugs were then later turned
around and fed to the consumer directly, with the thought that some
marketing jazz would be a sufficient reason to use it. Everything from the
drugs that they marketed, to the food they produced, all tainted by
corporate greed. With food being such an important component of everyone's
lives, I think that greater care should be taken to ensure that entities
that are controlling them act with a consumer first approach instead.
